Paradigm: Graph
Vendor-supported clients: Java
Open-source clients: NodeJS (experimental), Ruby, Clojure (+++)

## Description

Neo4j is a mature graph database used by major actors [reference]. 

## Querying

Neo4j supports querying with a proprietary query language, CYPHER [reference]. For more advanced queries one can use the Java APIs (Core and Traversal) [reference]

## Import (?)
One may import data from csv files, or via custom import routines.

## Interface
Neo4j may be used in two ways, as embedded or as a standalone REST server.

## Implementation

Neo4j is implemented in pure Java.

## Licensing

Dual license. GPLv3 or Enterprise Licence.

## Is a good fit for:

Highly relational data, social networks, graph-like data structures.

## Limitations

The database can't be sharded. Requires fast disks and lots of memory.

## Good places to start
